# Voice Dictation Tool

Hold a hotkey to record your voice, release to transcribe and type the text into any application.

Uses OpenAI Whisper (via faster-whisper) with GPU acceleration for fast, accurate transcription.

## Prerequisites

### 0. Internet Connection (First Run Only)

The first time you run the tool, it downloads the Whisper speech model (~500MB).
After that, the model is cached and works offline.

### 1. Python 3.11+ (Required)

**Option A - Microsoft Store (easiest):**
1. Open Microsoft Store
2. Search "Python 3.13"
3. Click Install

**Option B - python.org:**
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.13+
3. Run installer
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

**Option C - winget:**
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.13
```

### 2. NVIDIA GPU + CUDA (Optional, but recommended)

For fast transcription (~1-2 seconds), you need an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.

**Check if you have an NVIDIA GPU:**
1. Press `Win+X` → Device Manager
2. Expand "Display adapters"
3. Look for "NVIDIA GeForce..." or "NVIDIA RTX..."

**If you have NVIDIA GPU, install CUDA Toolkit:**
1. Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
2. Select Windows → x86_64 → 11 → exe (local)
3. Download and install (use Express installation)
4. Restart your computer

**No NVIDIA GPU?** The tool will automatically use CPU mode. It's slower (~5-10 seconds) but works fine.

## Installation

1. **Run the installer:**
   ```
   Double-click: install.bat
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - The script will check for Python and GPU
   - Choose your hotkey (default: Alt+F)
   - Wait for dependencies to install

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```
   Double-click: test-install.bat
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the tool:**
   ```
   Double-click: start-dictation.bat
   ```

2. **Dictate:**
   - Hold your hotkey (default: Alt+F)
   - Speak clearly
   - Release the hotkey
   - Text appears in your active window

3. **Stop:** Close the console window

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
- Install Python (see Prerequisites above)
- Make sure "Add to PATH" was checked during installation
- Try restarting your computer

### "Access denied" or hotkey doesn't work
- Right-click `start-dictation.bat` → "Run as administrator"

### Transcription is slow
- You're probably in CPU mode
- Install NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit (see Prerequisites)
- Re-run `install.bat` to reconfigure

### "No microphone found" or "No audio captured"
- Check your microphone is connected
- Windows Settings → Sound → Input → Make sure correct mic is selected
- Windows Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Allow apps to access microphone
- Try unplugging and replugging USB microphones

### Model download fails or hangs
- Check your internet connection
- If behind a corporate proxy, you may need to configure proxy settings
- The model downloads to `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface` - ensure you have ~1GB free space
- Try again later if HuggingFace servers are slow

### CUDA/GPU errors at runtime
- Make sure CUDA Toolkit is installed (not just NVIDIA drivers)
- Restart your computer after installing CUDA
- Re-run `install.bat` to reconfigure

## Configuration

After installation, edit `config.py` to change settings:

```python
HOTKEY = 'alt+f'          # Your recording hotkey
MODEL_SIZE = 'small'      # tiny (fast) → large (accurate)
DEVICE = 'cuda'           # 'cuda' or 'cpu'
```
